    "Using the default parameters, this visualisation is too fast. Luckily, we can use the generic `pp.visualisation.plot` function to pass a style for the visualisation. We can use all parameters that we used for static networks, plus additional parameters that influence temporal aspects of the visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of particular importance are the parameters `ms_per_frame` and `ts_per_frame`: The first specifies how many time units will be shown in one frame of the visualisation, allowing us to compress the visualisation by showing multiple timestamps in a single frame. This is helpful when you want to coarse-grain visualisations of high-resolution temporal network data. The parameter `ms_per_frame` defines the target frame rate of the visualisation by adjusting how many milliseconds each frame is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two more parameters will influence the force-directed layout algorithm, that is used to position nodes in the network. In a temporal network, the question is which time-stamped edges should be taken into account for the force-calculation at any given time stamp. If we only consider currently active edges, the layout will change too fast to recognize interesting patterns. If we consider all edges at every time step, node positions will be static despite the dynamics of edges. In real settings we want a compromise between those extremes, i.e. we specify a time window around the current time stamp within which edges are taken into account in the force-directed layout calculation. We can achieve this by setting the number of timestamps to consider before and after the currently shown frame via the `look_ahead` and `look_behind` parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can style active and inactive nodes and edges individually via the parameters `active_edge_width`, `inactive_edge_width`, `active_node_color`, and `inactive_node_color`. This allows us to change the color and/or size of nodes/edges whenever they are involved in an interaction."

    "Finally, we briefly introduce custom visualisation templates, which you may find useful for data-driven and visual story-telling tasks. As an example, we will use a data set on character co-occurrences in the text of The Lord of the Rings. You can load it from the table `lotr` in the SQLite database. In this table, each row source, target, time captures that the characters source and target are mentioned within the same sentence, where time chronologically numbers sentences throughout all three novels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we want to generate a nice interactive visualisation of this data set. For this, we will use the custom templating mechanism of pathpy. It allows you to define your own HTML templates, that you can derive from the default visualisation templates that we have used so far. This enables us to use the default pathpy visuals as a baseline, that we can tune to our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, such a template is nothing more than an HTML5 file with embedded JavaScript and CSS code. pathpy will use this template, and replace placeholder variables that we can set via the style parameter dictionary. We can tell pathpy to use an arbitrary custom template file by setting the entry `style['template'] = filename`. In this template, we can then use variables in the form `$variable`, which we can set from within python by setting `style['variable'] = value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the custom template file data/custom_template.html we use all of pathpy's default style parameters, as well as two additional parameters chapter_data and character_classes. We will use the first to pass chapter marks to the visualisation, which are then shown in the top left part of the visualisation as the story unfolds. Moreover, we will visualise the different factions (Hobits, Elves, Fellowship, Dwarves, ...) to which characters belong, so we need to pass those to the template as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read the character and chapter data from the corresponding json-files in the data directory. Just use the json.load function in python's json file to read them into two dictionaries and pass those two dictionaries to the corresponding style parameters."
