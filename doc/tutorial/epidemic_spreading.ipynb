In this directed acyclic graph, each change of a state of node w at time t is represented by a time-unfolded node 'w-t'., i.e. the directed acyclic graph can be thought of as a time-unfolded static representation of the process evolution. In addition, an edge (v-t', w-t) indicates that prior to node w changing its state, a node v connected to w changed its state at time t'<t.
