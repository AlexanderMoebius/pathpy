    "`pathpy` provides basic support for evaluations based on cross-validation experiments. In particular, the `train_test_split` method can be used to create train and test splits. The semantics of the method as well as the arguments is similar to the [corresponding function in `sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html).\n",
