The absendce of edges is encoded by zero entries. The size of an adjacency matrix representation of a network with n nodes is generally $n^2$, which is not suitable for networks with thousands or millions of nodes. `pathpy` nevertheless supports efficient adjacency matrix calculation for *sparse* networks, i.e. networks where the majority of node pairs are not connected by an edge.
