    "Shouldn't the likelihoods of these three models be identical? They are not, and this is a major issue when we have data that consists of large numbers of short paths: in terms of the number of transitions that enter the likelihood calculation, a model of order $k$ discards the first $k$ nodes on each path. That is, a second-order model can only account for all but the first edge traversals on the path. This means that - in the general case - we actually compare likelihoods computed for different sample spaces, which is not valid. Let us highlight this by calculating the number of transitions that enter the likelihood calculation:"

    "To fix the issues above, we need a probabilistic generative model that can deal with large collections of (short) paths in a network. The key idea is to combine multiple higher-order network models into a single multi-layered, `multi-order model`. To calculate the likelihood of such a model we can use all layers, thus avoiding the problem that we discard prefixes of paths. For each path, we start the calculation at a layer of order zero, which considers the relative probabilities of nodes. We then use this model layer to calculate the probability to observe the first node on a path. For the next transition to step two, we then use a first-order model. The next transition is calculated in the second-order model and so on, until we have reached the maximum order of our multi-order model. At this point, we can transitively calculate the likelihood based on the remaining transitions of the path.\n",
