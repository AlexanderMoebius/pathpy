    "\n",
    "An important question in the drawing of networks is where nodes are placed. The positioning of nodes determines whether it is easy to spot patterns in the topology of the network. As a general rule, good network visualisations should have a small number of crossing edges and nodes should be placed away from each other such that we can easily distinguish them. If we make no other effort, pathpy will automatically use a simple, interactive force-directed layout algorithm. It is based on the idea that nodes connected by an edge are moved towards each other by an attractive force, while an additional repulsive force between all node pairs makes sure that nodes are not drawn on top pf each other. The simulation of those forces, and the computation of a steady-state of the resulting many-particle system is what determines the node positions in the default pathpy visualisation. Also, this is the basis upon which nodes move if you disturb the visualisation by dragging around nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the default layout algorithm makes it simple to visualise networks, it has the disadvantage that the layout is actually calculated in JavaScript. This means that the positions of nodes are actually not stored in python, which makes it impossible to influence (or store) node positions from python. To solve this issue, `pathpy` provides a `layout` module that can be used to precompute node positions based on different layout algorithms. Moreover, it allows to manually optimise the parameters of those algorithms to generate a nice visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The styling of node positions via a layout style follows the same idea like the styling of plots via a plot style. We can store the parameters in a dictionary and pass them to the `layout` function using the ** operator. To compute ode positions based on a certain number of iterations of the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm with a specific force value we can write:"
