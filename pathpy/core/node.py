class Node(BaseNode):
    """Base class for a single node.

    A node (or vertex) is the fundamental unit of which networks are formed. In
    general nodes are treated as featureless and indivisible objects, although
    they may have additional structure depending on the application from which
    the netwokr arises.

    The two nodes forming an :py:class:`Edge` are said to be the endpoints of
    this edge, and the edge is said to be incident to the nodes.

    In ``pathpy`` the node is referenced by its unique identifier (``uid``) and
    can store any arbitrary python objects as attributes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uid : str

        The parameter ``uid`` is the unique identifier for the node. Every node
        should have an uid. The uid is converted to a string value and is used
        as a key value for all dict which saving node objects.

    kwargs : Any

        Keyword arguments to store node attributes. Attributes are added to the
        node as ``key=value`` pairs.

    Examples
    --------
    Load the ``pathpy`` module and create an empty :py:class:`Node` object.

    >>> from pathpy import Node
    >>> u = Node('u')

    Get the id of the node.

    >>> u.uid
    'u'

    Create a node with attached attribute.

    >>> u = Node('u', color='red')
    >>> u['color']
    'red'

    Add attribute to the node.

    >>> u['shape'] = 'circle'
    >>> u['shape]
    'circle'

    Change single attribute.

    >>> u['color'] = 'blue'

    Update multiple attributes.

    >>> u.update(color='green', shape='rectangle')

    Make a copy of the node.

    >>> v = u.copy()
    >>> v.uid
    'u'

    Make a plot element and plot the node as a png image.

    .. todo::

        Make a single plot command for plotting nodes.
        The code below is not working yet!

    >>> plt = u.plot()
    >>> plt.show('png')

    .. plot::

       import pathpy as pp
       u = pp.Node('u', color='green', shape='rectangle')
       net = pp.Network()
       net.add_node(u)
       plt = net.plot()
       plt.show('png')
